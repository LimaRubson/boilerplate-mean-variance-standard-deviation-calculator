# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This is the boilerplate for the Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

# My collaboration in the project:
The repository contains a file called mean_var_std.py, which includes a function named calculate. This function is designed to perform statistical calculations on a list of 9 digits, treating them as elements of a 3x3 matrix. The implementation uses the NumPy library to facilitate efficient processing of matrix operations and statistics.

## Function Signature
```python
    import numpy as np

    def calculate(lst):
        # Function implementation
```
## Input
The calculate function accepts a single parameter, lst, which must be a list containing exactly 9 numeric elements.

## Exception Handling
If the input list does not contain exactly 9 elements, the function raises a ValueError exception with the message "List must contain nine numbers."

## Matrix Processing
The input list is converted into a NumPy 3x3 matrix using np.array(lst).reshape(3, 3).
Various statistical calculations are then performed on the matrix, including mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum, both along the rows and columns.

## Result Format
The function returns a dictionary containing the results of the calculations. The format of the dictionary is as follows:
```python
{
  'mean': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'variance': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'standard deviation': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'max': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'min': [axis1, axis2, flattened],
  'sum': [axis1, axis2, flattened]
}
```

## Usage Example
```python
# Example of using the function
result = calculate([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8])
print(result)
```
